An interactive web app built with **Streamlit** to analyze the most common keywords used in recent Reddit posts from a selected subreddit. This tool helps identify trending topics and engagement patterns within any community, without requiring API keys or authentication.

**Note:** This project is currently incomplete due to the lack of Reddit API access. Redditâ€™s updated API policy requires approved authentication for live data access, which is pending.
